# Chi-Square-Test-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Using R, I wanted to determine if there was an association between customers who have (or do not have) a technical support add-on and whether the customer has discontinued service in the past month. Since both variables were categorical, I decided to use a chi-squared test. From my testing, I could not reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there was no evidence to suggest a statistically significant association between Churn and TechSupport. 
In this project, I also created visualizations of various univariate and bivariate relationships within the dataset.
